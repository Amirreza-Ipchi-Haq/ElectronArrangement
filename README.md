[Update]: This program does not show the sub-layers and is for people who only know the Bhor's atomic model. There's a newer version of this program which shows the sub-layers. You can go to its repository from this [link](https://github.com/Amirreza-Ipchi-Haq/ElectronArrangement2).
# ElectronArrangement
This program uses the Schr√∂dinger's formula to show the electron arrangement. It can also show the electron arrangement for unknown atoms.
